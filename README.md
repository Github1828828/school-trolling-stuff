uhm, idk if these work for u but they do for me, so, download the .TXT file (text file) and then open the files app on your chromebook/pc/laptop. then double click or open the text file and copy one of the websites you would like to use during the time, aka a OP kahoot flooder, or blooket hacks, or snake mods.
